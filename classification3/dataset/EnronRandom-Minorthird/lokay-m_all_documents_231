Once again, I am sending you the pdf file for the latest and greatest news 
about the SAP implementation.  We found out the computer I used this time had 
a different version of Acrobat so try this one.   Double click on the 
attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  If the error message that no 
application is found, click your START button,  click on Programs and then 
Utilities which should bring up Acrobat Reader at the top.  Click on that and 
load the application. 

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different version, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.
