Michael Slade forwarded me your advice  with respect to the Non-Disclosure 
Agreement with i2 Technologies.  We appreciate your help on this.  Per my 
conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many 
coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and 
pursuing US based customers.  We wanted to confirm with you that on a going 
forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees 
executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.  Thanks for your 
help with this.
