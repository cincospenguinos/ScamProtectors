hanging out with you last night.  I hope you know that I have always 
considered you one of MY friends too and I was very stoked that you seem to 
feel the same way.  Anyway have a great weekend and make sure to keep in 
touch.  And anytime you are game to grab a beer or you are hanging out in my 
part of town please give me a call.  Keep in touch sweetie!
