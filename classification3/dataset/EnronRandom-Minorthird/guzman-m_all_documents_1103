Group,

Once again we are having issues with a lack of  detail in the day and night 
discussion notes.  Anytime there is a cut, whether you think it is 
insignificant or not, it must be mentioned in your note at the end of your 
shift.  This is true for any schedule that EPMI is involved in......EPE, 
preschedules, RT schedules.  Since all these schedules are now tagged, it 
would be helpful to mention the tag number in your note as well.  In general, 
the notes have been too brief and lack the detail that is necessary to 
resolve any after that fact.  Let's take the time to do them right and make 
everyone else's life a bit easier. 

Thanks,
Jesse
