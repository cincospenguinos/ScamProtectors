Pat,

Thanks for your comments on the agreement.  As an FYI, the stock awards 
already have been made, so we had to soften the language in the agreement to 
address that situation.

I appreciate your other thoughts.  

Mary, could you or someone in your group help me in putting together an 
example as suggested by Pat?

Thanks.

Michelle
