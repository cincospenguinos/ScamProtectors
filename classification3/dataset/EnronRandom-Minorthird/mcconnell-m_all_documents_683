let him know that we looked around and couldn't find anything.  Also please

Mike,

Thanks for the quick follow-up. My background is in the sales, marketing, 
strategic planning and M&A areas in the industrial sector. Do not know if 
there is a fit, but I had hoped to explore possibilities with you.
