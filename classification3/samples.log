Dear Friend,
Good day to you,

and a business man named George Marshall who deposited a
huge sum of money(NINE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

died as a result of a fatal plane crash with other
passengers on board sometime in 1999 but since then we have
not had anybody coming for the claims as the next of Kin.
A situation I have carefully monitored closely with my
position in the bank.Now having monitored this deposit and
managed it over the years before his death,and hence nobody

concluded by me and i am only waiting for a foreigner to

   I heard somewhere (can't name the source) that TEMPEST does not necessarily
   pick-up just CRTs, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  If
   that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  Can anybody verify
   or refute this?

Yes, that's true.  TEMPEST is nothing magic, it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff. 

The nice thing about old CRTs is that they used to put out LOTS of
signal, so they're easy to detect, and if you do your sync carefully,
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked
Chevy Step-Van.  Some brands of electric typewriters were even worse.
In both cases, it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at, rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk, etc.

With newer, quieter equipment, there isn't as much signal, and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts.  TEMPEST-rated equipment has much lower signal levels.
But "Everything has vibrations", as Master Chuan said.

Hi,

If you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
SDK of some sort that contains the HC.EXE or HC31.EXE file to 
compile and generate .HLP files out of .RTF files.
RTF files are generated by a wordprocessor like Word for Dos or W4W.

If this is not the solution be more specific about your application.

Mario
