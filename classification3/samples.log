So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of 
course, there's the "they'll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions." Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?

They removed /their/ Java VM. They didn't remove the ability to run Java
programs.
Anybody is free to develop their own Java VM and make it kick ass. As
someone said earlier in the thread, nobody is capable or willing to do that.

I've done a bunch of Java and haven't run into huge problems running the
same bytecode across Solaris or Win2K.
What actual problems have people actually run into. Actually.

Not really.  Try again?  About half the developers on the spambayes project
were missing some permission or other, so I ran thru all of them and checked
every damned box and clicked on every damn dropdown list I could find.  As
far as SF is concerned, you're all sitting on God's Right Hand now, so if it
still doesn't work I suggest you upgrade to Win98 <wink>.
