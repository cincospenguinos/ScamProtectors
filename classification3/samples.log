 My Dear Partner,
I am Dr.Francis S. Mboma, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am
an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &
Natural Resources affiliated (created ) to the Department of Minerals and
Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty - Five
Million, Five Hundred And Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,560,000.)
which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.
This amount $45.560m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your
share of the sum will be 25% of the $45.560 million, 70% for us and 5% for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on
your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel
number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.

In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale, 
but once something is out in the world, the "creator" loses control... If I 
buy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by 
you're definition, he just stole from you.

>Fair use needs to be clarified a bit and then I hope they start locking

>that makes things people are supposed to ... *drumroll* pay for.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called "advertising": "buy one, get one free", "free shipping on any order 
over $25", "buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free", "free popcorn 
with any movie rental", "free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter", 
"the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.

Mike

Point is, you're not likely to extrapolate much.  I could probably
find one hetero who had just as much sex.   Does that mean we're all
rampant hos?  No.

Listen.  If you pull numbers like that without a fact, the automagic
assumption is yes, they were extracted out of your neither orifice.
Point wasn't to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits.
Its not my job to do _your_ bit searching for you, but I figured I'd
humor fork with this bit of finding:

averages of about 13 for every 3 months (for gay men), which totals to
about  52 a year.  52 a year doesn't equal 3000.   Or even 300.

WTF do my shitty math skillz have to do with girls and
hyperpromiscuity?  I was speaking -generally- meaning that guys and
girls probably have better things to do than boink everything they
see.  As above, I am assuming you're pulling things out of your ass, I
just felt like calling you on it.

BTW, there's nothing wrong with calling someone on a silly idea.  Its
allowed, and its generally not considered ad hominem, but the
homophobia statement might be.

Many times.  Which is why I said 'assuming that large ... (The meccas
dont count).  SF is a mecca in this example.  I obviously wasn't
clear, tho one could assume I wasn't talking about Medina.

doesn't happen?  true.   Couldn't happen?  who knows.   It has nothing
to do with how I 'feel' and everything to do with the fact that people
do concern themselves with more than just sex (otherwise I think we'd
see a helluva lot more of sex, and a helluva lot less of everything
else).

Well my suggestion is, if you can't take the responses, don't post
flamebait.

    Yeah, I'm one of them.  Ximian, if it could be installed from Apt would be sweet- the graphics are done very, very well.  The usability is actually higher than most other environments.  But their installer really sucks.

    If you find/setup one (and figure out how to install it) let me know.
