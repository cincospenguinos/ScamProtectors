Hi Xperts,

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
I can't believe there is no XView wizards any more 8-)...

I'm using sliders in my XView apps, usually with editable numeric
field. But I seem to have no control over the length of this field.
In some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
PANEL_MAX_VALUE! 

As I understand, PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH, which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
contains the following bit:

	/* Panel_multiline_text_item, Panel_numeric_text_item,
	 * Panel_slider_item and Panel_text_item attributes
	 */
	PANEL_NOTIFY_LEVEL	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_ENUM,			 152),
	PANEL_VALUE_DISPLAY_LENGTH	= PANEL_ATTR(ATTR_INT,		 182),

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
But 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
this attribute gives warning: Bad attribute, and returns value 0.

Strange thing is that DEC's port of XView gives plenty of space
in a text fields, but not Sun's Xview...

Can someone share his experience in managing sliders in XView with me,
and clear this problem? 

Any help is very much appreciated.

Yuri

My office email experience hasn't gone without some gliches.  I told Armin
that something really strange must be going on because I was getting emails
from some of you and not from all of you.  I told him it seemed like some of
my emails were, in fact, MUST be missing.  He blew me off like I didn't know
what I was doing (which is mostly correct).  BUT that's beside the point,
then last night after dinner he confessed that his office computer was
probably taking my emails before I got a chance to download them!  The
thief!  So if I seemed to be ignoring some of your emails that's because I
wasn't getting them.  Armin had his on automatic download, I made him turn
that off...THIS IS MY TURF!  Now I will received all emails first.  Write
me!

A new addition to the parodical genre of 419 ("Nigerian Money Laundry Scam") 
letters from members of the Shrub establishment, following up on Cheney's 
letter[1]. 

    I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of 
    America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current 
    circumstances. 

    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two 
    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my 
    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

Inc. (New York City).

Bill Bennetta
_________________________________________________

"[M]ost pseudo-scientists have a number of characteristics in
common.

        "First and most important of these traits is that cranks work
in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful
contacts with fellow researchers. . . . The modern crank insists
that his isolation is not desired on his part.  It is due, he claims,
to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new
ideas. . . .

        "The modern pseudo-scientist . . . stands entirely outside
the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are
introduced and evaluated.  He works in isolation.  He does not
send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they
are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases
are excellent.  In most cases, the crank is not well enough
informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance
to a significant study.  As a consequence, he finds himself
excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally
ignored by the competent workers in his field.  In fact, the
reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's
existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through
non-academic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby
of collecting crank literature.  The eccentric is forced, therefore,
to tread a lonely way.  He speaks before organizations he
himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may
edit, and -- until recently -- publishes books only when he
or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed
privately.

        "A second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which
greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward
paranoia. . . .

        "There are five ways in which the sincere pseudo-
scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited.

        "(1) He considers himself a genius.

        "(2) He regards his colleagues, without exception, as
ignorant blockheads.  Everyone is out of step except himself.
Frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of
stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives.  If they ignore
him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable.
If they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he
is battling scoundrels. . . .

        "(3) He believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated
against. . . .

        "(4) He has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the
greatest scientists and the best established theories.  When
Newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works
in that science were violently anti Newton.  Today, with
Einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of
physics is likely to attack Einstein in the name of Newton. . . .

        "(5) He often has a tendency to write in a complex
jargon, in many cases making use of terms and phrases he
himself has coined. . . ."

Couldn't resist sending this!!!!!!!!!!! Sandy
Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress "private" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

this is cute.  


  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.
