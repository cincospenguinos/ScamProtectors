Dear Sir,
Thank you for your online application for a Business Account with Wells Fargo. We appreciate your interest in banking with us. 
In order to open a Business Account, we must receive specific credit information that is verifiable. Because Wells Fargo has no locations in your state, we are unable to confirm the credit information in your application. Consequently, we regret to say that we cannot open an account for your business at this time.
Attached are your Wells Fargo Application and your Social Security File.
Sincerely, 
Sherli Chin

Hi,
This is Vasil Nanchev. I just wanted to inform you about something
which is really time sensitive. For the first time in  20 years,
America is going to witness the launch of a new nationwide
newspaper.  "THE USA TIMES" will  launch on  Jan. 1 2004, and
the
promotion is on now. You can join for free and bring other members
into the program to get a great residual income for life. They are
promoting it through MLM and paying on 5 levels. This is going to
get huge and people who act now will be earning a lot of money  in
the years to come.
Don't waste time and sign-up at
http://www.newsbucks.com/index.php?id=49641 
As soon as you sign-up (for free), just contact me and I will tell
you how to get other people to join the program. If only 10 people
(which could be your friends, family members or co-workers)
sign-up
under you, you can make thousands of dollars every month without
doing any work. It's true! 
I am really excited and I am sure you will be too after you read
the complete details.
Here is the link again ...

(pace Giraudoux)

To be more precise, I believe that there will be no "war of civilizations"
between the Western and the Muslim, and not because of drum-beating or
war-mongering from some parts, but due to stuff like this:

  http://www.lemonde.fr/article/0,5987,3210--286553-,00.html

>L'assemblée nationale turque a réalisé l'impossible : pour satisfaire
>aux demandes de l'Union européenne, le Parlement, lors d'une session
>qui a duré plus de seize heures, a, aboli la peine de mort (sauf en
>cas de guerre), éliminé les obstacles légaux à l'éducation et à la
>diffusion en langue kurde, levé certaines restrictions rendant
>l'organisation de manifestations difficile et mis fin à l'imposition
>de peines pour critiques envers l'armée ou d'autres institutions étatiques.

i.e., 

>The Turkish National Assembly achieved the impossible: to satisfy
>European Union demands, the Parlement, during a session lasting more
>than sixteen hours, abolished the death penalty (except in war time),
>eliminated legal obstacles to teaching and spreading of the Kurdish
>language, lifted certain restrictions making it difficult to organise

>and other state institutions.


This is the way forward, IMO.  Just wait a couple of years until
66 million Muslim Turks are making great strides towards democracy
and prosperity in the E.U. and Syria, Lebanon etc start lining up and
making similar decisions.

Of course there are hard-liners who would be right at home on
Rumsfeld's staff, but they got out-voted:

>La peine de mort s'est révélée le sujet le plus épineux : les
>ultra-nationalistes étaient déterminés à obtenir la pendaison du
>dirigeant du PKK (kurde), Abdullah Öcalan, considéré par les Turcs
>comme personnellement responsable de la mort de plus de 30 000
>personnes.  Öcalan avait été condamné à mort en juin 1999, mais le
>gouvernement avait accepté d'attendre le verdict de la Cour européenne
>des droits de l'homme avant de l'exécuter.  De nombreux nationalistes
>estimaient également que l'octroi de droits culturels aux Kurdes
>représenterait une concession aux revendications des "terroristes".

i.e.,

>The death penalty turned out to be the thorniest issue: the
>ultra-nationalists were determined to secure the hanging of the PKK
>leader, Abdullah Öcalan, considered by the Turks to be personally
>responsible for the deaths of more than 30,000 people.  Öcalan had
