Dear Presidents,
I am excited to work with each of you!  As a newly called stake RS
president, I'd like to introduce myself and help you feel comfortable with
me.  I grew up in southern Idaho, served a mission to Taiwan, married my
high school sweetheart, and have 5 children.  Four of the five are married
and my youngest just graduated from Herriman High and will be heading to
BYU-I next week.  We lived in Washington state for 27 years and moved to
Herriman just three years ago.  We have six grandchildren and so far they
all live in Utah, so I am happy.  ;)  I have been a Sunday School teacher
and a Webelos leader since we moved here, but have served most of my adult
life in Relief Society.  (Often simultaneously in Primary.) I have served as
a counselor to two stake RS presidents so I know that some of the greatest
blessings that come from this calling include associating with you.   I love
the gospel of Jesus Christ, I love sisters (women), and I love to serve.
Relief Society is a great combination of things I love.  My counselors and I
want to support you and your presidencies and lighten your burdens.   Please
let us know how we can best do that.  
I believe the handbook is inspired and try to always follow the direction of
the Brethren.  Some things are left up to preference so I have a couple of
questions to help me know how things have been running in your wards.  Could
each of you please let me know how you have divided the responsibilities of
your presidency?  I'd like to know which of your counselors oversees
teaching and which oversees the additional RS meetings.  Also, who have you
assigned to work with single adults and transition as well as music, etc.
Feel free to let me know of any concerns or issues you'd like help or
direction with. I'd also love to hear some of your best practices-things
that have been successful and helpful to your sisters.  Also, could you
please let me know the best way to contact you?  (IE: is this the best
email?  Do you have a cell phone and can you receive text messages?  Would
you prefer a phone call and to what #, etc.)
As there are changes in your presidencies, please let us know so we can
update our records and orient new leaders.  We are planning our annual stake
RS training meeting for the end of October.  I will let you know the exact
date as it is confirmed.  Louene gave glowing reports about each of you.
I'm grateful for the service and sacrifice you offer.  Thank you for your
faithfulness.  I look forward to hearing from you. 
Lovingly,
Angela Doutre

works and how we get paid on claims pip coverage in utah is minimum of 
we bill our normal rates and once the pip is patients normally have an attorney 
who settles the claim and gets the outstanding bills we normally don't allow patient to 
go beyond of treatment without an attorney since the attorney signs an attorney which requires 
that we get paid out of the recall making an exception in your case since 
you felt you could settle the claim on your own and wanted to pursue it 
without an attorney and assured us we would get since trusted didn't feel you would 
take the settlement and not get us as we varied from our normal policy of 
requiring an attorney or that the balance be paid in full each the insurance did 
pay our visit charges in full for what we billed up until the pip policy 
had been it is not that we were hoping to be paid more per visit 
than what they but rather the policy based upon the limits you purchased with your 
car it is not as though they not paying but rather the policy limits were 
this is why statement was given to you with the balance and discussions about getting 
that balance paid by the at fault party upon settlement took as discussed here are 
some of the notes that the staff put into our software about your dec pip 
exhaust letter from bear will tell the doctor so that he can talk to about 
her dec woodward talked to about the pip the balance and she is working with 
auto owners on payment of her outstanding she is planning on getting our bills paid

from the 3rd party car set up her account to default from corrective care pi 
case to case for future told her we would discount visits to for stabilization care 
if paid at time of feb all paperwork requested from auto owners insurance so we 
could receive payment on balance owing upon march woodward asked that give printout of her 
statement as she settled with her insurance and is going to pay us the balance 
gave her statement the assumption that there were visits and each visit is equalling is 
purely the offer is given to our patients that are entering stabilization and have concluded 
corrective treatment that charge is never given for corrective or intensive which is what your 
treatment was for in the car we also only offer that discount in stabilization care 
when payment is made at the time of not when we are awaiting payment or 
having to do there are also charges for and in addition to treatment since they 
are extra services regardless of what phase of care patient is in. i'm confused as 
to where the misunderstanding took our office had given you statement showing balance and you 
had planned on getting it paid through the settlement with the at fault please help 
me south utah office fax s. river front parkway on apr at family dear dr 
this is hope you remember me. my son and are patients of i'm sorry to 
bother you with but feel you are the only one that can help me. few 
weeks back received bill in the mail from your offices for at first was but 
then realized that it must be some kind of billing and decided would try and 
call or come into your office to clear it few days later got call from 
who informed me that this was not an but that only owed your office needless 
to say was again rhonda informed me that since the insurance had only paid was 
responsible for the when tried to explain to her that that wasn't possible because at 
the time of my services was told that the insurance money would cover my and 
when it got to the point that the insurance would not cover my was told 
and then began paying for my visits she did not agree with me and insisted 
owed the asked her to send me copy of the and told her would look 
it which have as look over the statement it shows that there were visits made 
by to your under the insurance once the coverage was no longer as made the 
payment of each time had an i'm no rocket but if you multiply times you 
get which is the amount that the insurance realize that you may have been hoping 
for the insurance to pay but don't think should have to pay more than what 
would have paid had been paying for it also noticed that the insurance company was 
sending payments at the time of my and at that time no one ever once 
suggested to me that the amount they were paying was not yet year and half 
i'm told owe bit outrageous don't you would also point out that could have gone 
to doctor who accepted my and only been charged dollar for each have to say 
that it bothers me that am having to send this and have both benefited and 
enjoyed our time in your having said we also have paid for the treatments we 
and think it is wrong to expect us to pay more than what was agreed 
sincerely hope you can help me with this realize your office may be having financial 
difficulties as are but that is not my have paid my portion for my would 
also suggest that the office might want to reconsider how they go about dealing with 
their accounting issues so that they don't alienate your people will have hard time returning 
to your offices or referring others if they feel that they were treated hope you 
can assist me in this i'm really sorry to hear about that sounds like quite

got call from who informed me that this was not an but that only owed 
your office needless to say was again rhonda informed me that since the insurance had 
only paid was responsible for the when tried to explain to her that that wasn't 
possible because at the time of my services was told that the insurance money would 
cover my and when it got to the point that the insurance would not cover 
my was told and then began paying for my visits she did not agree with 
me and insisted owed the asked her to send me copy of the and told 
her would look it which have as look over the statement it shows that there 
were visits made by to your under the insurance once the coverage was no longer 
as made the payment of each time had an i'm no rocket but if you 
multiply times you get which is the amount that the insurance realize that you may 
have been hoping for the insurance to pay but don't think should have to pay 
more than what would have paid had been paying for it also noticed that the 
insurance company was sending payments at the time of my and at that time no 
one ever once suggested to me that the amount they were paying was not yet 
year and half i'm told owe bit outrageous don't you would also point out that

hard time returning to your offices or referring others if they feel that they were 
treated hope you can assist me in this

treatment. Let me first explain a bit about how car insurance works and =
how we get paid on claims normally.=20
>>=20
>> PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill our normal rates =
and once the PIP is exhausted, patients normally have an attorney who =
settles the claim and gets the outstanding bills paid. We normally don't =
allow a patient to go beyond $3,000 of treatment without an attorney =
since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which requires that we get =
paid out of the settlement. I recall making an exception in your case =
since you felt you could settle the claim on your own and wanted to =
pursue it without an attorney and assured us we would get paid. Since I =
trusted you, I didn't feel you would take the settlement and not get us =
paid. As such, we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney =
or that the balance be paid in full each visit. The insurance did pay =
our visit charges in full for what we billed up until the PIP policy had =
been maxed. It is not that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than =
what they paid, but rather the policy maxed based upon the limits you =
purchased with your car insurance. It is not as though they "were not =
paying enough" but rather the policy limits were reached. This is why a =
statement was given to you with the balance and discussions about =
getting that balance paid by the at fault party upon settlement took =
place, as discussed below.

your case.

her statement as she settled with her insurance and is going to pay us =
the balance owing. I gave her a statement today.

>> The assumption that there were 50 visits and each visit is $60 =
equalling $3,000 is purely coincidental. The $60 offer is given to our =
patients that are entering stabilization and have concluded a corrective =
 treatment plan. That charge is never given for corrective or intensive =

for your letter. I'm sorry to hear of your frustrations with our billing =
department and the delays in following up with you earlier on the =
balance. I went back through the notes in the computer on your account, =
your treatment card and discussions I recall we had during treatment. =
Let me first explain a bit about how car insurance works and how we get =
paid on claims normally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill =
our normal rates and once the PIP is exhausted, patients normally have =
an attorney who settles the claim and gets the outstanding bills paid. =
We normally don't allow a patient to go beyond $3,000 of treatment =
without an attorney since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which =
requires that we get paid out of the settlement. I recall making an =
exception in your case since you felt you could settle the claim on your =
own and wanted to pursue it without an attorney and assured us we would =
get paid. Since I trusted you, I didn't feel you would take the =
settlement and not get us paid. As such, we varied from our normal =
policy of requiring an attorney or that the balance be paid in full each =
visit. The insurance did pay our visit charges in full for what we =
billed up until the PIP policy had been maxed. It is not that we were =
hoping to be paid more per visit than what they paid, but rather the =
policy maxed based upon the limits you purchased with your car =
insurance. It is not as though they "were not paying enough" but rather =
the policy limits were reached. This is why a statement was given to you =
with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by the =
at fault party upon settlement took place, as discussed below.</div>
our software about your case.</div><div><br></div><div>Dec 4, 2009 =
"Received PIP exhaust letter from Bear River. I will tell the doctor so =
that he can talk to Sherrie about her options.</div>
<div>Dec 16, 2009 "Dr. Woodward talked to Sherrie about the PIP exhaust, =
the balance and she is working with Auto Owners on payment of her =
outstanding claims. She is planning on getting our bills paid without an =
attorney.&nbsp;</div>
<div>January 29, 2010 "Released from PI care. Spoke to patient about =
outstanding bill. She will get it paid from the 3rd party car carrier. =
Set up her account to default from corrective care PI case to =
stabilization/cash case for future visits. Told her we would discount =
visits to $60 for stabilization care if paid at time of service.</div>
<div>Feb 12, 2010 "Sent all paperwork requested from Auto Owners =
Insurance so we could receive payment on balance owing upon =
Sherrie a printout of her statement as she settled with her insurance =
and is going to pay us the balance owing. I gave her a statement =
today.</div>
<div><br></div><div>The assumption that there were 50 visits and each =
visit is $60 equalling $3,000 is purely coincidental. The $60 offer is =
given to our patients that are entering stabilization and have concluded =
a corrective &nbsp;treatment plan. That charge is never given for =
corrective or intensive care, which is what your treatment was for in =
the car accident. We also only offer that discount in stabilization care =
when payment is made at the time of visit, not when we are awaiting =
payment or having to do billing. There are also charges for re-exams and =
x-rays in addition to treatment charges, since they are extra services =
regardless of what phase of care a patient is in.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I'm confused as to where the misunderstanding took =
place. Our office had given you a statement showing a balance and you =
had planned on getting it paid through the settlement with the at fault =
party. Please help me understand.&nbsp;</div>

me. &nbsp;My son Braden and I are patients of yours. &nbsp;I'm sorry to =
bother you with this, but I feel you are the only one that can help me. =
A few weeks back I received a bill in the mail from your offices for =
$8,206.25. &nbsp;At first I was shocked, but then I realized that it =
must be some kind of billing error, and decided I would try and call or =
come into your office to clear it up. &nbsp;A few days later I got a =
call from Rhonda, who informed me that this was not an error, but that I =
only owed your office $5580.00. &nbsp;Needless to say I was again =
shocked! &nbsp;Rhonda informed me that since the insurance had only paid =
$3000.00 I was responsible for the rest. &nbsp;When I tried to explain =
to her that that wasn't possible because at the time of my services I =
was told that the insurance money would cover my treatment, and when it =
got to the point that the insurance would not cover my visits, I was =
told so, and I then began paying for my visits myself. &nbsp;However, =
she did not agree with me and insisted I owed the $5580.00. &nbsp;So, I =
asked her to send me a copy of the statement, and I told her I would =
look it over, which I have done.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>As I look over the statement it shows that there =
were 50 visits made by me, to your office, under the insurance coverage. =
&nbsp;Once the coverage was no longer available, as I stated, I made the =
payment of $60 each time I had an appointment. &nbsp;I'm no rocket =
scientist, but if you multiply 50 times $60 you get $3,000.00, which is =
the amount that the insurance paid.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>I realize that you may have been hoping for the =
insurance to pay more, but I don't think I should have to pay more than =
what I would have paid had I been paying for it myself. &nbsp;I also =
noticed that the insurance company was sending payments at the time of =
my services, and at that time no one ever once suggested to me that the =
amount they were paying was not enough. &nbsp;Yet now, a year and a half =
later, I'm told I owe $5580.00! &nbsp;A bit&nbsp;outrageous don't you =
think? &nbsp;I would also point out that I could have gone to a doctor =
who accepted my insurance, and only been charged a 15 dollar copay for =
each visit. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have to say that it bothers me that I am having to =
send this email. &nbsp;Braden and I have both benefited and enjoyed our =
time in your offices. &nbsp;However, having said that, we also have paid =
for the treatments we received, and I think it is wrong to expect us to =
pay more than what was agreed upon. &nbsp;I sincerely hope you can help =
me with this matter. &nbsp;I realize your office may be having financial =
difficulties as are many, but that is not my responsibility. &nbsp;I =
have paid my portion for my visits. &nbsp;I would also suggest that the =
office might want to reconsider how they go about dealing with their =
accounting issues so that they don't alienate your&nbsp;clientele. =
&nbsp;People will have a hard time returning to your offices or =

Dr. Woodward,
First I want to apologize for seeming to take so long in solving this
issue, but a few days after we picked up all the paper work Mark had to go
out of town.  The day after he returned from his trip he woke up with
double vision.  To make a long story short he ended up having a
brain hemorrhage and had to have brain surgery.  He is finally now at home
recovering.
We hope that you will be able to have a little more patience with us as we
try to resolve this issue.  We have not yet been able to look things over,
and we still need to get information from Auto Owners with regards to what
they were paying towards medical bills.  At the time of the settlement Mark
and I were both under the impression that the amount they gave us was to
cover the cost of replacing the truck, and that the medical portion was
being taken care of separately.  Now we realize that may not have been the
case.  We received 10k in the settlement, and used 7k to replace the truck.
 My brother in-law was selling his truck, and so we were able to get a good
deal on replacing our truck.  The remaining 3k we put into saving.
I do not want to push Mark in his recovery, but as soon as he seems up to
it we will take a look at things and get back to you.  Hopefully we will be
able to tackle it in the next week or so.  Thank you again for your
patience.
Sincerely,
Sherrie Kirkham

Dr. Woodward,=A0<div><br></div><div>First I want to apologize for seeming t=
o take so long in solving this issue, but a few days after we picked up all=
 the paper work Mark had to go out of town. =A0The day after he returned fr=
om his trip he woke up with double vision. =A0To make a long story short he=
 ended up having a brain=A0hemorrhage and had to have brain surgery. =A0He =
is finally now at home recovering. =A0</div>
<div><br></div><div>We hope that you will be able to have a little more pat=
ience with us as we try to resolve this issue. =A0We have not yet been able=
 to look things over, and we still need to get information from Auto Owners=
 with regards to what they were paying towards medical bills. =A0At the tim=
e of the settlement Mark and I were both under the impression that the amou=
nt they gave us was to cover the cost of replacing the truck, and that the =
medical portion was being taken care of=A0separately. =A0Now we realize tha=
t may not have been the case. =A0We received 10k in the settlement, and use=
d 7k to replace the truck. =A0My brother in-law was selling his truck, and =
so we were able to get a good deal on replacing our truck. =A0The remaining=
 3k we put into saving. =A0</div>
<div><br></div><div>I do not want to push Mark in his recovery, but as soon=
 as he seems up to it we will take a look at things and get back to you. =
=A0Hopefully we will be able to tackle it in the next week or so. =A0Thank =
you again for your patience.=A0</div>

<div><br></div><div>PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill ou=

orney since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which requires that we get=
 paid out of the settlement. I recall making an exception in your case sinc=
e you felt you could settle the claim on your own and wanted to pursue it w=
ithout an attorney and assured us we would get paid. Since I trusted you, I=
 didn&#39;t feel you would take the settlement and not get us paid. As such=
, we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney or that the bal=
ance be paid in full each visit. The insurance did pay our visit charges in=
 full for what we billed up until the PIP policy had been maxed. It is not =
that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than what they paid, but rath=
er the policy maxed based upon the limits you purchased with your car insur=
ance. It is not as though they &quot;were not paying enough&quot; but rathe=
r the policy limits were reached. This is why a statement was given to you =
with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by the at =
fault party upon settlement took place, as discussed below.</div>

get paid on claims pip coverage in utah is minimum of we bill our normal 
rates and once the pip is patients normally have an attorney who settles the claim 
and gets the outstanding bills we normally don't allow patient to go beyond of treatment 
without an attorney since the attorney signs an attorney which requires that we get paid 
out of the recall making an exception in your case since you felt you could 
settle the claim on your own and wanted to pursue it without an attorney and 
assured us we would get since trusted didn't feel you would take the settlement and 
not get us as we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney or 
that the balance be paid in full each the insurance did pay our visit charges 
in full for what we billed up until the pip policy had been it is 
not that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than what they but 
rather the policy based upon the limits you purchased with your car it is not 
as though they not paying but rather the policy limits were this is why statement 
was given to you with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by

get paid on claims pip coverage in utah is minimum of we bill our normal 
rates and once the pip is patients normally have an attorney who settles the claim 
and gets the outstanding bills we normally don't allow patient to go beyond of treatment 
without an attorney since the attorney signs an attorney which requires that we get paid 
out of the recall making an exception in your case since you felt you could 
settle the claim on your own and wanted to pursue it without an attorney and 
assured us we would get since trusted didn't feel you would take the settlement and 
not get us as we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney or 
that the balance be paid in full each the insurance did pay our visit charges 
in full for what we billed up until the pip policy had been it is 
not that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than what they but 
rather the policy based upon the limits you purchased with your car it is not 
as though they not paying but rather the policy limits were this is why statement 
was given to you with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by

for your letter. I'm sorry to hear of your frustrations with our billing =

Let me first explain a bit about how car insurance works and how we get =
paid on claims normally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill =
our normal rates and once the PIP is exhausted, patients normally have =
an attorney who settles the claim and gets the outstanding bills paid. =
We normally don't allow a patient to go beyond $3,000 of treatment =
without an attorney since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which =
requires that we get paid out of the settlement. I recall making an =
exception in your case since you felt you could settle the claim on your =
own and wanted to pursue it without an attorney and assured us we would =
get paid. Since I trusted you, I didn't feel you would take the =
settlement and not get us paid. As such, we varied from our normal =
policy of requiring an attorney or that the balance be paid in full each =
visit. The insurance did pay our visit charges in full for what we =
billed up until the PIP policy had been maxed. It is not that we were =
hoping to be paid more per visit than what they paid, but rather the =
policy maxed based upon the limits you purchased with your car =
insurance. It is not as though they "were not paying enough" but rather =
the policy limits were reached. This is why a statement was given to you =
with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by the =
at fault party upon settlement took place, as discussed below.</div>
our software about your case.</div><div><br></div><div>Dec 4, 2009 =

given to our patients that are entering stabilization and have concluded =
a corrective &nbsp;treatment plan. That charge is never given for =
corrective or intensive care, which is what your treatment was for in =
the car accident. We also only offer that discount in stabilization care =
when payment is made at the time of visit, not when we are awaiting =
payment or having to do billing. There are also charges for re-exams and =
x-rays in addition to treatment charges, since they are extra services =
regardless of what phase of care a patient is in.</div>
<div><br></div><div>I'm confused as to where the misunderstanding took =
place. Our office had given you a statement showing a balance and you =
had planned on getting it paid through the settlement with the at fault =
party. Please help me understand.&nbsp;</div>

me. &nbsp;My son Braden and I are patients of yours. &nbsp;I'm sorry to =
bother you with this, but I feel you are the only one that can help me. =
A few weeks back I received a bill in the mail from your offices for =
$8,206.25. &nbsp;At first I was shocked, but then I realized that it =
must be some kind of billing error, and decided I would try and call or =
come into your office to clear it up. &nbsp;A few days later I got a =
call from Rhonda, who informed me that this was not an error, but that I =
only owed your office $5580.00. &nbsp;Needless to say I was again =
shocked! &nbsp;Rhonda informed me that since the insurance had only paid =
$3000.00 I was responsible for the rest. &nbsp;When I tried to explain =
to her that that wasn't possible because at the time of my services I =
was told that the insurance money would cover my treatment, and when it =
got to the point that the insurance would not cover my visits, I was =
told so, and I then began paying for my visits myself. &nbsp;However, =
she did not agree with me and insisted I owed the $5580.00. &nbsp;So, I =
asked her to send me a copy of the statement, and I told her I would =
look it over, which I have done.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>As I look over the statement it shows that there =
were 50 visits made by me, to your office, under the insurance coverage. =
&nbsp;Once the coverage was no longer available, as I stated, I made the =
payment of $60 each time I had an appointment. &nbsp;I'm no rocket =
scientist, but if you multiply 50 times $60 you get $3,000.00, which is =
the amount that the insurance paid.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>I realize that you may have been hoping for the =
insurance to pay more, but I don't think I should have to pay more than =
what I would have paid had I been paying for it myself. &nbsp;I also =
noticed that the insurance company was sending payments at the time of =
my services, and at that time no one ever once suggested to me that the =
amount they were paying was not enough. &nbsp;Yet now, a year and a half =
later, I'm told I owe $5580.00! &nbsp;A bit&nbsp;outrageous don't you =
think? &nbsp;I would also point out that I could have gone to a doctor =
who accepted my insurance, and only been charged a 15 dollar copay for =
each visit. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br></div><div>I have to say that it bothers me that I am having to =
send this email. &nbsp;Braden and I have both benefited and enjoyed our =
time in your offices. &nbsp;However, having said that, we also have paid =
for the treatments we received, and I think it is wrong to expect us to =
pay more than what was agreed upon. &nbsp;I sincerely hope you can help =
me with this matter. &nbsp;I realize your office may be having financial =
difficulties as are many, but that is not my responsibility. &nbsp;I =
have paid my portion for my visits. &nbsp;I would also suggest that the =
office might want to reconsider how they go about dealing with their =
accounting issues so that they don't alienate your&nbsp;clientele. =

<div><br></div><div>I realize that you may have been hoping for the insuranc=

Dr. Woodward,
Do you think you could send me copies of all the paper work you have
regarding my treatment, so that my husband and I can look it over and see
if we can figure this thing out?
Thanks

your frustrations with our billing department and the delays in following u=

<div><br></div><div>PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill ou=

orney since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which requires that we get=
 paid out of the settlement. I recall making an exception in your case sinc=
e you felt you could settle the claim on your own and wanted to pursue it w=
ithout an attorney and assured us we would get paid. Since I trusted you, I=
 didn&#39;t feel you would take the settlement and not get us paid. As such=
, we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney or that the bal=
ance be paid in full each visit. The insurance did pay our visit charges in=
 full for what we billed up until the PIP policy had been maxed. It is not =
that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than what they paid, but rath=
er the policy maxed based upon the limits you purchased with your car insur=
ance. It is not as though they &quot;were not paying enough&quot; but rathe=
r the policy limits were reached. This is why a statement was given to you =
with the balance and discussions about getting that balance paid by the at =
fault party upon settlement took place, as discussed below.</div>
software about your case.</div><div><br></div><div>Dec 4, 2009 &quot;Receiv=

<div>Dec 16, 2009 &quot;Dr. Woodward talked to Sherrie about the PIP exhaus=

<div>Feb 12, 2010 &quot;Sent all paperwork requested from Auto Owners Insur=

to say was again rhonda informed me that since the insurance had only paid was 
responsible for the when tried to explain to her that that wasn't possible because at 
the time of my services was told that the insurance money would cover my and 
when it got to the point that the insurance would not cover my was told 
and then began paying for my visits she did not agree with me and insisted 
owed the asked her to send me copy of the and told her would look 
it which have as look over the statement it shows that there were visits made 
by to your under the insurance once the coverage was no longer as made the 
payment of each time had an i'm no rocket but if you multiply times you 
get which is the amount that the insurance realize that you may have been hoping 
for the insurance to pay but don't think should have to pay more than what 
would have paid had been paying for it also noticed that the insurance company was 
sending payments at the time of my and at that time no one ever once 
suggested to me that the amount they were paying was not yet year and half 
i'm told owe bit outrageous don't you would also point out that could have gone 
to doctor who accepted my and only been charged dollar for each have to say 
that it bothers me that am having to send this and have both benefited and 
enjoyed our time in your having said we also have paid for the treatments we 
and think it is wrong to expect us to pay more than what was agreed 
sincerely hope you can help me with this realize your office may be having financial 
difficulties as are but that is not my have paid my portion for my would 
also suggest that the office might want to reconsider how they go about dealing with 
their accounting issues so that they don't alienate your people will have hard time returning 
to your offices or referring others if they feel that they were treated hope you 
can assist me in this

Hi Sherrie,
Thank you for your letter. I'm sorry to hear of your frustrations with =
our billing department and the delays in following up with you earlier =
on the balance. I went back through the notes in the computer on your =
account, your treatment card and discussions I recall we had during =
treatment. Let me first explain a bit about how car insurance works and =
how we get paid on claims normally.=20
PIP coverage in Utah is a minimum of $3,000. We bill our normal rates =
and once the PIP is exhausted, patients normally have an attorney who =
settles the claim and gets the outstanding bills paid. We normally don't =
allow a patient to go beyond $3,000 of treatment without an attorney =
since the attorney signs an attorney lien, which requires that we get =
paid out of the settlement. I recall making an exception in your case =
since you felt you could settle the claim on your own and wanted to =
pursue it without an attorney and assured us we would get paid. Since I =
trusted you, I didn't feel you would take the settlement and not get us =
paid. As such, we varied from our normal policy of requiring an attorney =
or that the balance be paid in full each visit. The insurance did pay =
our visit charges in full for what we billed up until the PIP policy had =
been maxed. It is not that we were hoping to be paid more per visit than =
what they paid, but rather the policy maxed based upon the limits you =
purchased with your car insurance. It is not as though they "were not =
paying enough" but rather the policy limits were reached. This is why a =
statement was given to you with the balance and discussions about =
getting that balance paid by the at fault party upon settlement took =
place, as discussed below.
Here are some of the notes that the staff put into our software about =
your case.
Dec 4, 2009 "Received PIP exhaust letter from Bear River. I will tell =
the doctor so that he can talk to Sherrie about her options.
Dec 16, 2009 "Dr. Woodward talked to Sherrie about the PIP exhaust, the =
balance and she is working with Auto Owners on payment of her =
outstanding claims. She is planning on getting our bills paid without an =
attorney.=20
January 29, 2010 "Released from PI care. Spoke to patient about =
outstanding bill. She will get it paid from the 3rd party car carrier. =
Set up her account to default from corrective care PI case to =
stabilization/cash case for future visits. Told her we would discount =
visits to $60 for stabilization care if paid at time of service.
Feb 12, 2010 "Sent all paperwork requested from Auto Owners Insurance so =
we could receive payment on balance owing upon settlement.
March 4, 2010 "Dr. Woodward asked that I give Sherrie a printout of her =
statement as she settled with her insurance and is going to pay us the =
balance owing. I gave her a statement today.
The assumption that there were 50 visits and each visit is $60 equalling =
$3,000 is purely coincidental. The $60 offer is given to our patients =
that are entering stabilization and have concluded a corrective  =
treatment plan. That charge is never given for corrective or intensive =
care, which is what your treatment was for in the car accident. We also =
only offer that discount in stabilization care when payment is made at =
the time of visit, not when we are awaiting payment or having to do =
billing. There are also charges for re-exams and x-rays in addition to =
treatment charges, since they are extra services regardless of what =
phase of care a patient is in.
I'm confused as to where the misunderstanding took place. Our office had =
given you a statement showing a balance and you had planned on getting =
it paid through the settlement with the at fault party. Please help me =
understand.=20

Dear Dr Woodward,
This is Sherrie Kirkham.  I hope you remember me.  My son Braden and I are
patients of yours.  I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I feel you are
the only one that can help me. A few weeks back I received a bill in the
mail from your offices for $8,206.25.  At first I was shocked, but then I
realized that it must be some kind of billing error, and decided I would
try and call or come into your office to clear it up.  A few days later I
got a call from Rhonda, who informed me that this was not an error, but
that I only owed your office $5580.00.  Needless to say I was again
shocked!  Rhonda informed me that since the insurance had only paid
$3000.00 I was responsible for the rest.  When I tried to explain to her
that that wasn't possible because at the time of my services I was told
that the insurance money would cover my treatment, and when it got to the
point that the insurance would not cover my visits, I was told so, and I
then began paying for my visits myself.  However, she did not agree with me
and insisted I owed the $5580.00.  So, I asked her to send me a copy of the
statement, and I told her I would look it over, which I have done.
As I look over the statement it shows that there were 50 visits made by me,
to your office, under the insurance coverage.  Once the coverage was no
longer available, as I stated, I made the payment of $60 each time I had an
appointment.  I'm no rocket scientist, but if you multiply 50 times $60 you
get $3,000.00, which is the amount that the insurance paid.
I realize that you may have been hoping for the insurance to pay more, but
I don't think I should have to pay more than what I would have paid had I
been paying for it myself.  I also noticed that the insurance company was
sending payments at the time of my services, and at that time no one ever
once suggested to me that the amount they were paying was not enough.  Yet
now, a year and a half later, I'm told I owe $5580.00!  A bit outrageous
don't you think?  I would also point out that I could have gone to a doctor
who accepted my insurance, and only been charged a 15 dollar copay for each
visit.
I have to say that it bothers me that I am having to send this email.
 Braden and I have both benefited and enjoyed our time in your offices.
 However, having said that, we also have paid for the treatments we
received, and I think it is wrong to expect us to pay more than what was
agreed upon.  I sincerely hope you can help me with this matter.  I realize
your office may be having financial difficulties as are many, but that is
not my responsibility.  I have paid my portion for my visits.  I would also
suggest that the office might want to reconsider how they go about dealing
with their accounting issues so that they don't alienate your clientele.
 People will have a hard time returning to your offices or referring others
if they feel that they were treated unfairly.
I hope you can assist me in this matter.
Sincerely,
Sherrie Kirkham

Allie, Thank you so much! I can't believe you remembered!  We spent the
evening as a family with some of Paul's friends and his dad reminiscing
about his life.  It was touching and therapeutic.  Although, I find myself
missing him a little more today.
I hope you had a wonderful Birthday!  You certainly deserve it.  You are an
amazing women Allie, and I am so glad that I have been able to get to know
you better.  Thank you for all that you do for me!!
With Much Love,
Sherrie

Dear Sister Goodsell,
Elder Kirkham's grandmother past away early this morning, and I'm wondering
what the protocol is for letting him know of her passing. Would we be
allowed to call him to let him know, or is it preferable for us to just
email him with the news.
Thank you for your help,
Sister Sherrie Kirkham
Elder Kirkham's Mother

Sherrie,
I am forwarding this only to see if it's something that you and your sweet
hubby are interested in sharing. I am thinking that it is so delicate, so
dear to the heart, that you may not want to; but if you do, I know the
church wants to help others by getting some real life stories. Just junk
this email if you're not. No offense meant; I get these emails often and if
they don't apply to me, I usually forward them on.
MUCH LOVE!

Dear LDS Member,
The Church will film several stories for a suicide prevention initiative
beginning October 2017.
We seek members of the Church from Utah, Washington DC, and the New York
areas, to share their stories (and testimonies) about the delicate topic of
suicide.
For those applying from Utah, we would like to hear your story if you have
lost a loved one (spouse, parent, or caretaker) to suicide.
If you are from Washington DC or the New York area, we would like you to
share your story if you have attempted suicide. Please feel free to forward
this on to anyone with these experiences, who would be willing to share.
*PROJECT:* Suicide Prevention
*NEEDED:* Females, ages 20-104. All ethnicities.
*LDS:* Yes. Participants must be active members of the LDS Church with a
current temple recommend or ecclesiastical endorsement.
*SHOOT DATES:* October 2017
*TIME COMMITMENT:* 2 hours or less
*LOCATION:* Utah, Washington, DC, New York
*RATE:* Volunteer (as the time commitment is minimal and testimonies will
be shared, we ask that our guests volunteer their time. Thank you!)
*TO APPLY*
Please tell us your story.
   1. Video-record yourself telling us a bit about your story.
      1. This does NOT need to be professional. Feel free to use your cell
      phone (or any similar video-recording device).
      2. Please place the camera close enough so we can see your face
      clearly.
      3. Please make sure your video is clear, in focus, and has plenty of
      light.
      4. Verify that your sound is clear enough to be easily heard.
      5. Wardrobe: Casual
   2. For your recording:
      1. Tell us your full name and where you live (city).
      2. Take about 3 minutes (or less) to tell us briefly about your
      experience based on the topic mentioned above.
   3. Upload your video to an online video-site like YouTube or Vimeo.
   *IMPORTANT:* We will be unable to view videos set to "private." We
   recommend setting your privacy settings to "UNLISTED" although "Public" =
is
   also acceptable.
   4. Please complete this *FORM* <https://www.tfaforms.com/4635477>,
      1. Please upload a current still photo (taken with your phone or
      digital camera): (Only .jpg or .bmp formats will be accepted.)
PLEASE NAME
      EACH FILE with your FULL NAME (example: JohnSmith-1.jpg).
      2. The form also has an entry space where you may post the *URL
      address for your video*.
*APPLICATION DEADLINE:* Please submit your video (via the online form) by
midnight, *Saturday, September 30, 2017.*
PLEASE NOTE: Your application to this project is greatly appreciated.
However, we will not be able to include all the stories from everyone. We
will let you know as soon as possible if your story is selected, and
contact you to schedule a time.
Thank you for your interest and support of this important project.

If you'd like to that would be great, but if you can't I have asked my son
Wes to help.  We only need help this time cause I need to leave early, and
so we'll need someone to help drive them back.

First off, thank you all for getting back to me, and to all you who were
able to offer help.  Fortunately I've figured out we won't need it!  Also,
I apologize for all the emails, but my husband straightened me out
regarding 2 deep leadership when it comes to transportation, and we got
clarification from higher up.  As long as there are at least 2 boys in our
cars we are okay to drive the boys.  However, that does mean that we can
not pick them up or drop them off.  If this is a problem for some of you we
can pick them up or drop them off as long as we have other boys (at least 2
others) with us in the car.
We will be meeting at Callie's house tomorrow.  She is just one street over
from me at 14407 Rose Summit Drive.  I have permission slips already filled
out for you to sign, so please don't forget to do that before you leave.
If you're not dropping your child off and need the permission slip before
hand let me know and we can arrange for you to get it.
This is the last requirement for the boys to get their "Paws for Action"
which is a required activity, so try hard to have your son there.
Thanks for your patience as we've tried to figure this all out!

DAY OF FASTING AND PRAYER FOR AMERICA 
We, my wife and I, are firmly convinced that our elected politicians are
incapable of representing the will of the American people - and incapable of
adhering to the Constitution of the United States of America which they took
a solemn oath to uphold and defend. 
We are among the millions of U.S. Citizens who are at our wits end sending
e-mails, faxes, telephoning, meeting with elected officials, demonstrating,
rallying - and hoping - that those representatives will do the will of the
people. They have failed. Have we, as well? 
The United States of America is a choice land, a nation that was founded by
our forefathers who were divinely inspired by God the Father Almighty. This
choice nation has been the defender of freedom throughout its relatively
short history. We have led in the fight for freedom against many tyrants and
dictators who have plundered and pillared their citizens and have subjected
them to great sufferings through blood and horror. The people of those
nations who suffered these great injustices knew that they could always
depend upon the goodness, power and righteousness of the United States of
America to extract them from their plights. And it was done - many times
over. It was not done without expense - the expense of the blood and
sacrifice of the members of our armed forces - and the suffering of their
families. 
As the year 2009 soon comes to a close, we the citizens of the United States
of America finds ourselves facing many of the challenges - which those
nations suffered at the hands of their political leaders. We are being
attacked from within! Who do we turn to? Which great nation can we turn to
help us to keep and maintain our freedom? We do not have the same hope of
those nations to whom we were benefactors. 
We MUST turn to our Savior. If we are a righteous people, we will be
deserving of, and receive of His blessings as He has promised. He suffered
and died for us - He atoned for our sins; each one of us - individually. We
know that - as a nation - we can once again be the choicest of lands.
However, we cannot achieve that blessing without our willingness to please
our Lord and Savior. 
We are asking that all who read this message that have faith in Christ
designate Sunday December 6, 2009 as a day of fasting and prayer for America
. 
You do not have to march on the nation's Capitol nor go to a tea bag rally.
>From the comfort of your home, you can get on bended knee and with a broken
heart and contrite spirit, petition the Lord to bless this nation generously
according to His will. Then, keep the fast for that day. Make that
Christ-like commitment to our Heavenly Father. He will listen, He will
answer. That has been promised. 
"And whatsoever he shall ask the father in my name, which is right,
believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you." (3
Nephi 18-20) "And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
ye shall receive." (Matthew 21:22) 
Joe and Janice Hagen St. George, UT.

to tell you do you remember when worked at the hotel in he would usually 
stop by my house on his way on one such night that he did took 
pen and wrote verse on his all wrote was the psalm don't remember why did 
maybe he was having bad day or something can't so he went to work that 
and he said woman came in in the middle of the night to get and 
kind of looked upset or worn at the counter she notices he has verse written 
on his hand and she asks him what it is. he says my girlfriend wrote 
its and she opens her bag and gets bible out and immediately looks up the 
reference at rest once my for the lord has been good to to which he 
said she said to him needed to read then when she checks out the next 
day she had note left for written on the hotel tablet that said something along 
the lines of thanking him and his girlfriend for their and that that she needed 
that verse that night more than he'd ever and then she signed it and her 
name was was blown away when he told me he had given me her note 
and kept the note for long and may still have it some want to send 
it to you if find wrote down the date it happened in my bible next

warmed my it is good to hear from you have also moved away from minnesota 
and miss it it is strange always look back at my years with as my 
sort of as grew up with him from teenager to hitting my he definitely influenced 
some of who am today because of the thing will always remember is his love 
of finding the philosophical in the ordinary and deeply talking about many it has made 
me more analytical and appreciative of the meaning in everyday this year has been difficult 
one for me and those had close family member pass away weeks and just all 
the events of this year has had me delve further into my faith with you 
are our peace is knowing that we will see them again one verse that has 
given me comfort regarding this is thessalonians we do not want you to be ignorant 
about those who have or to grieve like the rest of who have no we 
believe that jesus died and rose again and so we believe that god will bring 
with jesus those who have love we shouldn't grieve as those who have no for 
we have the hope that we will see them and yet it is still painful 
and sorrowful when we lose loved but can you imagine what it would feel like 
for those who do not believe in the hope of in the letter that my 
family member left after her she wrote meet you in and hold onto this hope 
want you to know that would be more than happy to send you missionary also 
am pretty sure that have one of his high school though don't remember which year 
and have no idea why he gave it to me. they are stored away some 
where at my parent's house who live just couple hours had been working out the 
logistics with she has decided she no longer wants me in her life at this 
point in things got felt like remembered you lived on logan falls that is all 
thank you for writing find it funny that you wrote that you weren't sure if 
it was because that is the exact same thing had been thinking all knowing what 
would be appropriate for me to involve myself in as knew what had happened the 
very hour it occurred in march and didn't know if it was fitting for me 
to offer my lindsay jul how are dearest don't know why am having such hard 
time writing this email to maybe feel guilty for letting so much time pass without 
any contact between should have kept in was going through some of things the other 
day and found small shoe box of pictures of you and it was very sweet 
to sit and relive some of my memories of our time in am so grateful 
we all had that time and hope that you are also hope that my email 
finds you well and you still hold special place in my heart and wish all

Dear Lindsay,
Please don't feel bad.  I know how life can be.  It saddens me to hear that
you are having to experience more loss in your young life.  I too have been
very busy, and haven't thought much about when you might be sending Paul's
belongings.  I am not worried.  I know you will send them when you can, and
that is fine by me.
I don't know if you remember Westley very much,  but he just returned home
from his mission to Croatia.  We are all very excited to have him home
again.  We feel a little more complete now, but not completely, without
Paul.
Thank you for sharing that story with me.  I remember Paul telling me about
it, but I had forgotten.  I love remembering stories about him.  We all miss
him very much.  He was the one to always make us laugh.  His father is going
in for open heart surgery on Tuesday.  Maybe you could remember him in your
prayers.  I am so grateful for the gospel in my life, and the knowledge that
I will be with those I love again.  But, even though they are not with us,
there is still joy to be found in this life.
With Much Love,
Sherrie

=A0<br>This year has been a difficult one for me and those i love. I had a =
close family member pass away 2 weeks ago, and just all the events of this =
year has had me delve further into my faith with God. You are right, our pe=

me comfort regarding this is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14 &quot;And now, we do n=
ot want you to be ignorant about those who have died, or to grieve like the=
 rest of men, who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again a=
nd so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have died.&quot; =
I love that, we shouldn&#39;t grieve as those who have no hope, for we have=
 the hope that we will see them again. And yet it is still painful and sorr=
owful when we lose a loved one, but can you imagine what it would feel like=
 for those who do not believe in the hope of heaven? In the letter that my =
family member left after her death, she wrote &quot;I&#39;ll meet you in=A0=
Heaven.&quot; And i hold onto this hope dearly.<br>

Dearest Lindsay=2C  I don't know why I am having such a hard time writing t=
his email to you.  Maybe I feel guilty for letting so much time pass withou=
t any contact between us.  I should have kept in touch.  I was going throug=
h some of Paul's things the other day and found a small shoe box of picture=
s of you and him.  It was very sweet to sit and relive some of my memories =
of our time in Minnesota.  I am so grateful we all had that time together=
=2C and I hope that you are too. =20
 I also hope that my email finds you well and happy!  You still hold a spec=
ial place in my heart Lindsay=2C and I wish all the happiness and joy in li=
fe that you can find.  You loved my son=2C and I am grateful to you for sha=
ring your love with Paul.  Even though his life was short I believe that he=
 contributed so much to this life.  The love he showed to others is not to =
be compared.  I know that we will be with him again=2C and that he continue=
s to spread love and goodness to those he loves. =20
 I have a favor to ask of you Lindsay=2C that I hope won't be too hard for =
you.  Melanie mentioned in passing that you were in possession of Paul's mi=
ssionary journal.  I'm hoping you won't mind me asking for=2C and that you =
would be willing to return his journal to me?  Paul had mentioned just a fe=
w months before his passing that his mission was one of the happiest times =
of his life=2C and I would love to be able to read about it and share in th=
at time with him.  Losing Paul is the hardest thing I have ever had to go t=
hrough. Having that small part of him would help to ease the pain=2C and I =
feel help to bring him closer to me.  I hope that I am not asking too much=
=2C and that this will not be to hard a thing for you to do.  I would love =
to hear from you=2C but I understand if it doesn't seem appropriate. =20
 I love you truly!  May God bless you in your life! My love and gratitude t=
o you! Love Paul's Mother=2C Sherrie
 P.S. Please send my love to your parents.   		 	   		 =20

Oh=2C Sherrie=2C please please please forgive me! It was incredibly rude of=
 me to let more than a week go by in responding to you=2C let alone a month=
. I am SO sorry! August met me with more tragedy...we lost 3 friends in a h=
orrific crash. I was travelling all over during August and barely had time =
to properly think. I want you to know i am genuinely sorry to have kept you=
 waiting for so long!!!&nbsp=3BThings have calmed down a bit now=2C I want =
to get those things squared away for&nbsp=3Byou and on its way.<BR>&nbsp=3B=
<BR>You&nbsp=3Bhad asked where i moved to=2C&nbsp=3BI am living in North Ca=
rolina! Lived in Las Vegas before that. Every where i go theres no snow!! T=
his ironically makes me sad.&nbsp=3BI miss Minnesota :)<BR>&nbsp=3B<BR>I wa=
nted to tell you a story=2C do you remember when Paul worked at the AmercIn=
n hotel in Lakeville? He would usually stop by my house on his way there. O=
n one such night that he did this=2C i took a pen and wrote a verse on his =
hand. All i wrote was the reference=2C Psalm 116:7. I don't remember why i =
did this=2C maybe he was having a bad day or something i can't recall. So h=
e went to work that night=2C and he said a woman came in in the middle of t=
he night to get a room=2C and kind of looked upset or worn out. At the coun=
ter she notices he has a verse written on his hand and she asks him what it=
 is. He says "oh my girlfriend wrote it=2C its a verse." And she opens her =
bag and gets a Bible out and immediately looks up the reference "Be at rest=
 once more=2C O my soul=2C for the Lord has been good to you." To which he =
said she said to him "Thank you=2C i needed to read that." Then when she ch=
ecks out the next day she had a note left for Paul written on the hotel tab=
let that said something along the lines of thanking him and his girlfriend =
for their kindness=2C and that that she needed that verse that night more t=
han he'd ever know. And then she signed it and her name was Faith! I was bl=
own away when he told me that=2C he had given me her note and i kept the no=
te for sooo long and i may still have it some where!! I want to send it to =
you if i find it. I wrote down the date it happened in my Bible next to tha=
t verse so i'd never forget=2C it was 1/29/04. I still wonder what was trou=
bling her that night=2C and find it so awesome that we accidently were able=
 to give her some comfort. God works in mysterious ways!!<br><BR>I hope the=
 beginning of fall is treating you well=2C again i am so sorry it took me s=
o long to write back.<BR>&nbsp=3B<BR>love=2C<BR>Lindsay<BR><br>&nbsp=3B<BR>=

Hello Sherrie :)<br>&nbsp=3B<br>Your email brightened my day and warmed my =
heart! It is good to hear from you :)<br>&nbsp=3B<br>I have also moved away=
 from Minnesota and miss it terribly. It is a strange thing=2C i always loo=
k&nbsp=3Bback at my 4 years with Paul as my sort of "transition years" as i=
 grew up with him from a teenager to a semi-adult hitting my 20s. He defini=
tely influenced some of who i am today because of this. The thing i will al=
ways remember is his love of conversation=2C finding the philosophical in t=
he ordinary and deeply talking about many a topic. It has made me a more an=
alytical person=2C and appreciative of the meaning in everyday life.<br>
&nbsp=3B<br>This year has been a difficult one for me and those i love. I h=
ad a close family member pass away 2 weeks ago=2C and just all the events o=
f this year has had me delve further into my faith with God. You are right=
=2C our peace is knowing that we will see them again one day. A verse that =
has given me comfort regarding this is 1 Thessalonians 4:13-14 "And now=2C =
we do not want you to be ignorant about those who have died=2C or to grieve=
 like the rest of men=2C who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and r=
ose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus those who have d=
ied." I love that=2C we shouldn't grieve as those who have no hope=2C for w=
e have the hope that we will see them again. And yet it is still painful an=
d sorrowful when we lose a loved one=2C but can you imagine what it would f=
eel like for those who do not believe in the hope of heaven? In the letter =
that my family member left after her death=2C she wrote "I'll meet you in&n=
bsp=3BHeaven." And i hold onto this hope dearly.<br>
&nbsp=3B<br>I want you to know that i would be more than happy to send you =
Paul's missionary journal! I also am pretty sure that i have one of his hig=
h school yearbooks=2C though i don't remember which year and i have no idea=
 why he gave it to me. They are&nbsp=3Bstored away&nbsp=3Bsome where at my =
parent's house who live just a couple hours away. I had been working out th=

Dear Lindsay,
Thank you for your kind sweet words.  I am sorry to hear that your year has
been a difficult one like mine.  It is a blessing to have the knowledge of
the gospel in our lives, to know that we will see our loved ones again, in
the flesh, is a true blessing.  Christ has told us "I am the resurrection
and the life.  He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he
live", and from Job we know that "though after my skin worms destroy this
body, yet in my flesh shall I see God."  What glorious knowledge to have.  I
know that I shall see Paul again, and I know that he is here looking after
us, as is your loved one looking after you.  I have felt his presence and it
has been a great comfort to me.
Thank you also for agreeing to send me Paul's things.  If there is anything
I can do to help with that, besides giving you my address ;-), just let me
know.  I was sorry to hear that you and Melanie have had a falling out.  I
hope that you will be able to work things out.  It is a blessing to have
friends in our lives. I know that mine have been a great comfort and support
to me.
You were right about our street being Logan Falls Lane. Our address is 14409
Logan Falls Lane, Herriman, UT 84096.  You mentioned that you are no longer
living in Minnesota, but you didn't say where you were living?  It is hard
being away from home, but if there is one thing I have learned in all our
travels, it is that you can be happy anywhere.  You just have to choose to
look for the good.
Thank you again for sweet words of support.  I pray that time will help heal
your heart, and make the memory of your loved one become sweet to you.
May God bless you in all that you do!
Love,
Sherrie
P.S. My cell phone number is 801-637-9959 if you should ever have need to
call me.

Hello Sherrie :)<br>=A0<br>Your email brightened my day and warmed my heart=

Dearest Lindsay,
I don't know why I am having such a hard time writing this email to you.
Maybe I feel guilty for letting so much time pass without any contact
between us.  I should have kept in touch.  I was going through some of
Paul's things the other day and found a small shoe box of pictures of you
and him.  It was very sweet to sit and relive some of my memories of our
time in Minnesota.  I am so grateful we all had that time together, and I
hope that you are too.
I also hope that my email finds you well and happy!  You still hold a
special place in my heart Lindsay, and I wish all the happiness and joy in
life that you can find.  You loved my son, and I am grateful to you for
sharing your love with Paul.  Even though his life was short I believe that
he contributed so much to this life.  The love he showed to others is not to
be compared.  I know that we will be with him again, and that he continues
to spread love and goodness to those he loves.
I have a favor to ask of you Lindsay, that I hope won't be too hard for
you.  Melanie mentioned in passing that you were in possession of Paul's
missionary journal.  I'm hoping you won't mind me asking for, and that you
would be willing to return his journal to me?  Paul had mentioned just a few
months before his passing that his mission was one of the happiest times of
his life, and I would love to be able to read about it and share in that
time with him.  Losing Paul is the hardest thing I have ever had to go
through. Having that small part of him would help to ease the pain, and I
feel help to bring him closer to me.  I hope that I am not asking too much,
and that this will not be to hard a thing for you to do.  I would love to
hear from you, but I understand if it doesn't seem appropriate.
I love you truly!  May God bless you in your life!
My love and gratitude to you!
Love Paul's Mother,
Sherrie
P.S. Please send my love to your parents.

was supposed to take us near after riding for some we became worried that we 
had missed the just young women got on the crowded her wonderful spirit immediately identified 
her as someone we needed to talk and is it turned she was indeed on 
her way to the same she led us off the train and to the chapel 
where we met the rest of the the and elder and sister elder thompson was 
serving as the district president at the can't begin to explain the spirit that was 
in that little tony and enjoyed three hours of meetings and then stayed and talked 
with the members and missionaries for some time attached at the risk of leaving someone 
won't try to mention each missionary by but they were all and their families should 
be very proud of their faithful service and the love shown to the people of 
as we left the the missionaries inquired about the rest of our when we explained 
that our wives would be arriving in the next few and that we would be 
traveling to the dalmatian we were told that we should visit the little branch in 
zadar where members we were given the name and phone number of elder hadley in

our route of because of the wonderful stories that we shared with sandi and cathy

group met to partake of the sacrament and learn the it would take me an 
hour to explain everything and every conversation intend to send this email to my and

be important to me the next day when we arrived in immediately called elder hadley 
and who assured me that they had found my lens and had tried to call 
us right after asked anxiously about the possibility of sending the lens via fed ex 
or and was told that these services couldn't help me under the the elders told 
me that they would contact bus driver who would be driving all the way to 
pula the next they told me that this bus driver would then be met by 
the missionaries in the next as soon as we pulled into the parking lot of 
wonderful roman colosseum in we called elder champion and within they arrived with strange package 
of plastic and scarf that carefully protected my it had been wrapped and sent by 
elder woods and what blessing this and quite took few pictures of the pula elders

Dear Bro. Stiles,
What a pleasant surprise to wake to your email.  Thank you so much for
thinking of us and sharing your experiences in Croatia.  As you know our
son, Elder Kirkham, is one of the missionaries serving in Zagreb.  He had
mention your visit, and told me that you would be sending pictures via
email, but I was a little confused as to what he was talking about.  Your
email has cleared everything up!  Thank you also for the pictures.  They are
amazing, and as a missionary mother they were a welcome gift.
Elder Kirkham is learning and growing so much from his experiences in
Croatia.  He has grown to love the people there so much, and it is exciting
as a parent to see his growth.  I just want to thank you again for allowing
us to see a part of his journey, and for sharing your thoughts on the
wonderful experience it was for you as well.
I look forward to seeing more of the pictures you've taken.  I have to say
there is one picture you took of Wes that is probably one of the best
pictures I have ever seen taken of him.  You are quite a skilled
photographer.
Anyways, thank you again.  I appreciate it more than I can say.
Sincerely,
Sis. Sherrie Kirkham

This is a family vacation/reunion and we have family driving in from
Arizona, California, Washington State and Lehi, Utah. We were wondering if
the cabins and/or the lodge are air conditioned. We want to be able to ride
ATV's and fish close by.

book your next vacation rental quickly and easily... no matter where you

Dear Braden,
By now you should be in Croatia and I hope you are enjoying the Holiday
season there.
We have been truly blessed to have the church in our lives.  To know our
Savior lives and loves us.  We should be forever grateful for His example
and His unconditional love.  I have been thinking about how lucky we are to
live in the United States of America.  Our founding fathers were men of God
and it is because of there belief in God that we have many freedoms and
luxuries that other countries do not enjoy.  
I pray for you everyday. You are a wonderful nephew and even though I tease
you all the time, I want you to know that I love you with all my heart.
May the Lord bless and keep you.
Love, 
Aunt Debbie (your favorite)
P.S. Uncle Bryon sends his love and wishes you the best.
Dear Braden,
This is Tony and the whole Tony Wyatt family speaking to you in unison. We
are so united as a family that we are speaking the same words to you at the
same time, just in different pitches. Benjamin's voice is cracking every now
and then as he is going through his voice change.
But seriously, we love and miss you and are grateful for the example you are
setting for our family. I know my boys look up to you and Westley. I know
you are doing the Lord's work and you will be blessed for your obedience and
diligence.  You can't go wrong when you are studying the scriptures and
serving the Lord.
We will be praying for you as a family in our nightly family prayers (I know
we should probably have prayer in the morning as well!). We think of you
often and wonder how you are doing.  Keep up the great work and it won't be
long before we see you again.
Love,
Tony and the whole Tony Wyatt Family

Dear ward RS Presidents,
I am gathering a group of sisters to sing a special number for our March
8th Women's Conference. There is so much talent in our stake and in your
individual wards!
But I need your help.
I would love to have 1-2 sisters from your ward who you feel could benefit
from being part of this event. Soprano or alto doesn't matter. The only
requirement is that they enjoy singing & can come to a couple rehearsals.
I will contact them personally if you will just send me their name &
number/email. Thank you so much for your help! If you have any questions,
feel free to call or text me as well @ 801.518.5453
I hope to have the group finalized this week so if you could respond as
soon as possible I would be very grateful!
Thanks again,
Cami

offers. You should notice a decline in the amount of unsolicited credit c=
ard offers you receive within the next 60 to 90 days (please note, you ma=

Processed EMail Body: 
Length of sample: 2609
from 
tue sep sent by with sep sep insurance claim family randy woodward dr. thank you 
for settling this with we have mailed check for to your making our account paid 
in full per our you should receive it within day or on aug at randy 
woodward you are correct that we have no desire to turn the account over to 
collection attorney and have it affect your credit plus attorney fees they add. really like 
and know her to be very good as will accept as payment in full and 
write off any remaining balance if you can get us paid over the next you 
have my assurance that with this payment you will have zero balance with our s. 
river front parkway south utah office fax on aug at family dr. but we disagree 
with your when you didn't receive payment if you would have sent bill immediately then 
this wouldn't have been an i've never been to any medical professional without them quickly 
sending me whether it was covered by insurance or continued going to your office for 
months after she was told that she had reached the limit of the insurance and 
no one ever said anything to her about an outstanding we never received single phone 
call or statement until few months when gave the statement to auto owners she believed 
your portion would be paid directly to you just like it was with bear since 
we had not received any bills or statements after the one that was given to 
auto owners we believed you had received would like for this to come to am 
willing to pay few months of reasonable figure months at amounting to is am willing 
to pay if have an assurance you won't attempt to collect any more from if 
this isn't acceptable to you then go ahead and send it to quite honestly if 
this was to go before judge would rather have my case than on jul at 
randy woodward as documented by staff and myself back when was completing care for the 
she was aware that there was an outstanding we gave her which she passed on 
to auto that is how they knew how much was owed to our auto owners 
then issued her payment for the amount that was outstanding with our that payment was 
never passed on to this is also documented in our computer notes input by staff 
that previously sent we do not agree that she was first notified few months we 
normally do not allow balance to be carried in our office on an auto accident 
without an attorney representing the patient in order to insure that the patient doesn't settle 
the receive our money and not pass it on to remember having this conversation with 
she was one of the very few exceptions we have made over the years and 
this is because she was not interested in having an attorney and trusted that she 
would pay us rather than taking our payment from the settlement and not get us 
that is what ended up was not told that she had reached the maximum amount 
allowed by the there is no set amount for but rather comes down to negotiations 
between the attorney and at fault or in this the patient and at fault the 
only exception to that would be the policy limits of the at fault which is 
minimally in what was told was that we had gotten her back to status and 
therefore any future maintenance care would have to be paid for by her and not 
the auto this is when she began making payments for this somehow it is being 
interpreted here that because she made payments at the we had been paid in this 
is not supported by the notes in the the conversations had with and the fact 
that auto owners received our outstanding bills from and made those payments directly to her. 
agree it would have been nice if patient statements had been sent to also think 
that since was aware at the time of this she should have at least contacted 
us to clarify this rather than depositing all the money and waiting for us to 
contact her. offered to cut the interest charges in half and meet you half way 
on we normally get paid of our interest charges on auto accident claims and don't 
reduce as many claims can take years to believe my offer to reduce them in 
half is more than please let me know right away how you would like to 
proceed so that we can prevent future interest from south utah office fax s. river 
front parkway on jul at family dr. and have both discussed and we both agree 
that we should not be responsible for the interest that has and here is we 
were first notified that we owed an outstanding balance just few month in the years 
that have past since treatment was completed we never once received statement or phone call 
from your office letting us know that balance was if we had been receiving bills 
from your office and failed to pay them until now we would agree that we 
should be responsible for the interest since we were not informed until recently one could 
say that the bill was allowed to remain past due so that interest could and 
greater amount of money we do believe however that that is not the and that 
this was simply the failure of your past business who allowed the bill to go 
this was confirmed when your current business manager shared with that she was hired to 
clean up the mess of the previous as we mentioned when we were told by 
your office that we had reached the maximum amount allowed by the insurance we believed 
that that meant you had been was told at that time that if she wanted 
to continue treatment she would have to pay for any additional treatments at the time 
of her for months she continued and paid for her visits at the time of 
never once with each visit was it suggested to her that her bill was not 
or that she owed anymore which reinforced in our minds the idea that your office 
had been paid for her treatment from the insurance we are not trying to be 
but had we known that the money had not been paid we would have promptly 
paid we feel that we should not be penalized because you had an office manager 
that was not doing her as mentioned before we are willing to pay the by 
the end of the month once we receive written confirmation that payment of that amount 
will render the account paid in on jul at randy woodward thanks for your the 
current balance on the account is was the balance at the time of since that 
time over years interest has continued to sherry had signed form stating that she understood 
interest would accrue at per we feel this is more than fair considering it was 
not our fault that the account was not paid at the time of settlement or 
when the services were we are willing to meet you half way on the interest 
charges and cut them in this would make the balance if this amount is paid 
before the end of the your account will be paid in south utah office fax 
s. river front parkway on jul at family dr we were finally able to get 
in touch with auto owners ins. the file for our claim is in but they 
did confirm that the settlement amount we received did include medical according to their notes 
the amount for medical was and have discussed and we both agree of that you 
are entitled to the if you will send us statement for that showing that if 
paid the account would be paid in we will promptly send you the thanks you 
for your and dr. thank you for settling this with have mailed check for to 
your making our account paid in full per our should receive it within day or 
o. on aug at randy woodward you are correct that we no ire to turn 
the account over to collection attorney and have it affect ur credit plus attorney fees

Sorry, but we disagree with your assessment. =A0When you didn&#39;t receive=

 ever said anything to her about an outstanding bill. =A0We never received =

 any bills or statements after the one that was given to Auto Owners we bel=

 =A0I am willing to pay a few months of reasonable interest. =A0I figure 6 =
months at 8.0% interest, amounting to $220, is reasonable. =A0I am willing =
to pay $5660 if I have an assurance you won&#39;t attempt to collect any mo=

Mark,
You are correct that we disagree. However, I have no desire to turn the =
account over to a collection attorney and have it affect your credit =
plus attorney fees they add. I really like Sherrie and know her to be a =
very good person. As such, I will accept $5660 as payment in full and =
write off any remaining balance if you can get us paid over the next =
week. You have my assurance that with this payment you will have a zero =
balance with our clinic.
Sincerely,

Dr.  Woodward,
Sorry, but we disagree with your assessment.  When you didn't receive
payment if you would have sent a bill immediately then this wouldn't have
been an issue.   I've never been to any medical professional without them
quickly sending me a bill, whether it was covered by insurance or
not. Sherrie continued going to your office for 5-6 months after she was
told that she had reached the limit of the insurance coverage, and no one
ever said anything to her about an outstanding bill.  We never received a
single phone call or statement until a few months ago.  When Sherrie gave
the statement to Auto Owners she believed your portion would be paid
directly to you just like it was with Bear River.  Since we had not
received any bills or statements after the one that was given to Auto
Owners we believed you had received payment.
However, I would like for this to come to a resolution.  I am willing to
pay a few months of reasonable interest.  I figure 6 months at 8.0%
interest, amounting to $220, is reasonable.  I am willing to pay $5660 if I
have an assurance you won't attempt to collect any more from us.  If this
isn't acceptable to you then go ahead and send it to collections.  Quite
honestly if this was to go before a judge I would rather have my case than
yours.
Mark

 =A0I am willing to pay a few months of reasonable interest. =A0I figure 6 =

Mark,
As documented by staff and myself back when Sherrie was completing care =
for the accident, she was aware that there was an outstanding balance. =
We gave her a statement, which she passed on to Auto Owners. That is how =
they knew how much was owed to our clinic. Auto Owners then issued her =
payment for the amount that was outstanding with our clinic. However, =
that payment was never passed on to us. This is also documented in our =
computer notes input by staff that I previously sent you. So, we do not =
agree that she was first notified a few months ago.
We normally do not allow a balance to be carried in our office on an =
auto accident without an attorney representing the patient in order to =
insure that the patient doesn't settle the claim, receive our money and =
not pass it on to us. I remember having this conversation with Sherrie. =
She was one of the very few exceptions we have made over the years and =
this is because she was not interested in having an attorney and I =
trusted that she would pay us rather than taking our payment from the =
settlement and not get us paid. Unfortunately, that is what ended up =
happening.
Sherrie was not told that she had reached the maximum amount allowed by =
the insurance. There is no set amount for a settlement, but rather comes =
down to negotiations between the attorney and at fault insurance, or in =
this case, the patient and at fault insurance. The only exception to =
that would be the policy limits of the at fault party, which is =
minimally $25,000 in Utah. What Sherrie was told was that we had gotten =
her back to pre-accident status and therefore any future maintenance =
care would have to be paid for by her and not the auto insurance. This =
is when she began making payments for this care. Somehow it is being =
interpreted here that because she made payments at the end, we had been =
paid in full. However, this is not supported by the notes in the =
computer, the conversations I had with Sherrie and the fact that Auto =
Owners received our outstanding bills from Sherrie and made those =
payments directly to her.
I agree it would have been nice if patient statements had been sent to =
you. I also think that since Sherrie was aware at the time of this =
balance, she should have at least contacted us to clarify this rather =
than depositing all the money and waiting for us to contact her. =
However, I offered to cut the interest charges in half and meet you half =
way on this. We normally get paid 100% of our interest charges on auto =
accident claims and don't reduce these, as many claims can take 1-3 =
years to settle. I believe my offer to reduce them in half is more than =
fair.=20
Please let me know right away how you would like to proceed so that we =
can prevent future interest from accruing.

Dr. Woodward,
Sherrie and I have both discussed it, and we both agree that we should not
be responsible for the interest that has accrued, and here is why.
We were first notified that we owed an outstanding balance just a few month
ago.  In the 2 1/2 years that have past since Sherrie's treatment was
completed we never once received a statement or phone call from your office
letting us know that a balance was owed.  If we had been receiving bills
from your office and failed to pay them until now we would agree that we
should be responsible for the interest accrued. But, since we were not
informed until recently one could say that the bill was allowed to remain
past due so that interest could accrue, and a greater amount of money
collected.
We do believe however that that is not the case, and that this was simply
the failure of your past business manager, who allowed the bill to go
uncollected.  This was confirmed when your current business manager shared
with Sherrie that she was hired to clean up the mess of the previous
manager.
As we mentioned before, when we were told by your office that we had
reached the maximum amount allowed by the insurance we believed that that
meant you had been compensated.  Sherrie was told at that time that if she
wanted to continue treatment she would have to pay for any additional
treatments at the time of her visits.  For months she continued treatment,
and paid for her visits at the time of treatment.  Never once with each
visit was it suggested to her that her bill was not paid, or that she owed
anymore money. Which reinforced in our minds the idea that your office had
been paid for her treatment from the insurance company.
We are not trying to be difficult, but had we known that the money had not
been paid we would have promptly paid it.  We feel that we should not be
penalized because you had an office manager that was not doing her job.
As mentioned before we are willing to pay the $5440.00 by the end of the
month once we receive written confirmation that payment of that amount will
render the account paid in full.
Sincerely,
Mark Kirkham

Dr Woodward,
     We were finally able to get in touch with Auto Owners Ins.  The file
for our claim is in storage, but they did confirm that the settlement
amount we received did include medical costs.  According to their notes the
amount for medical was $5,440.00.  Sherrie and I have discussed it, and we
both agree of course, that you are entitled to the money.  If you will send
us a statement for that amount, showing that if paid the account would be
paid in full, we will promptly send you the payment.
Thanks you for your consideration,
Mark and Sherrie Kirkham

Dear Relief Society Sisters,
This past Sunday during Relief Society we introduced a little "project"
that we would like all the sisters in our ward to do together for the next
10 weeks.  Each week we will be handing out a label with a short reading
assignment and a couple questions to ponder and journal about.  The idea is
that you will stick the label right in your journal and write your thoughts
and feelings as you read and ponder the questions.  We hope that this will
help all of us to draw closer to our Savior as we head into some of the
busiest weeks of the year.  I have gone through this Walk with Christ at
different stages in my life and it has been such a wonderful experience for
me.  Not only has it helped me to bring more focus to my scripture study, I
have also been truly blessed by going back and reading my old journals and
remembering the impressions I felt at different times in my life.  It has
been a much needed reminder that the Savior's love is always constant, no
matter what we are going through.
The labels will be available in all of the Relief Society binders on Sunday
and we will include the previous weeks as well for anyone who missed
picking up a label.  Each Sunday we will invite a sister to briefly share
her thoughts from the past week's reading assignment with the hope that we
can all share in this experience together.  I hope that you will all join
us in this Walk with Christ.  Please let me know if you have questions.
Love,
Jaimy

Subject: Fw: Mental Health Resources?
Hi! My name is Robyn Betts, I am the Stake LDS Family Services Outreach
Specialist, (in other words, Mental Health Specialist :) ). I live in the
Grand View Ward. I am looking for additional Counseling/Mental Health
Resources so I can have a thorough and extensive list for bishops and/or
anyone else in need of reputable mental health professionals.
If you know of any really good therapists/Drs who specialize in any mental
health issues, i.e. couples counseling, depression, ADD, autism, anxiety,
etc., would you mind emailing me the following information (please feel
free to list as many as you know):
Therapist's name
Specialty (i.e. depression, couples counseling, ADD, etc.)
Address (optional)
Phone number (optional)
I am also looking for any mental health specialists/Drs that you know of
who do speaking/presentations (for free) that would be beneficial for our
stake. This can be yourself, or someone in your ward/stake that you know

**If you feel uncomfortable, you do not need to disclose who you are, or
how you know these individuals are good, only the resource. If you do not
know their address or phone number, that's OK too, I can track that down.
Also, if you or any member of your family are in need of mental health
services and would like to see someone listed on your insurance, but aren't
sure who is good, email me your insurance name and the list of providers.
Also, if you are currently seeing someone you are unhappy with, and would
like to change, I will be happy to give you my recommendations. If I don't
know those listed on your insurance, I will know professionals who do and
can consult with them. Everything will be kept confidential.
I am also familiar with wilderness programs, hospitalizations for short
term or long term care for Adolescents and Adults, if you are in need of
any recommendations.
If you are in need of financial assistance, LDS Social Services is not the
only place the church, through the bishop, will pay for.
Thank you for your help! I look forward to serving with you!
Have a great day!

Bishop,
I got this from our stake Family Services Outreach Specialist, but I wanted
your approval before I sent it out to the sisters in our ward.  We are
having a RS quarterly meeting this Thursday on depression.  I could mention
this resource to the sisters at that meeting, and that I will be sending
out an email about it, but there will be a lot of sisters not at the
meeting, so like I said I want your approval before I did anything.
Thanks,
Sister Kirkham

Hey Wes,
I have another confession to make.  After sending your email, I logged into
your account to make sure our emails had made their way to you.  While there
I noticed that Ivan had responded to his email he had sent.  I thought it
was odd, and decided to read it.  Please don't be mad at me.  Your father
and I have both read the email and decided that we should probably give you
some advice with regards to it.  We realize that it's contents has
probably come as a shock to you, but either way we feel that you should
forward it to your mission president.  We realize also, that you may
have already thought of that and if you were aware of the situation you may
have already talked to him, but if not, please do so, because he will be
able to help you deal with the situation.  Also, be sure to copy any
correspondence you have with Ivan to your mission president.  But, be sure
to talk with Pres. Hill first before you respond to Ivan, if you even do.
 We are so sorry you are having to deal with this, but just know that we
love and support you and that everything will work out in the end.
Your Loving and Supportive Parents
Or, Mom and Dad
P.S. Please keep us informed as to what happens.  If you don't mind.
