Good Day,
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.
However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 
My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
 political asylum.
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 
President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.
I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.
Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 
For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 
I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.
I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Aleck --

I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I
sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes,
almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked
Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard
from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind
Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San
Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I
told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he
offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the
appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just
approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I
still have seen nothing.

My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that
Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems
unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me
directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this
matter.

Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.

Larry



assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would
pay a retainer in advance.

MARKET CAN'T FIND ITS BOTTOM WITH BOTH HANDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Nasdaq 2500 seemed impossibly low? Welcome back to 
cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a
market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire
assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can
get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the
self-pity can't get much worse.

The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but
you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst
monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. "3rd quarter
worst for stocks since '87," read the Denver Post, repeating a
popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage
losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for
the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937.
Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfilling prophecy" does spring to mind. 

So does the phrase "gloom and doom." "Every day for the last
three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the
United States," said the San Jose Mercury News. "Countless
investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up
again," wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement,
TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines "demonstrated
once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint 
a bottom" and "disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time
to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history 
has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond." 

OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better?
Good, because there's more.

The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to
understand, made the public service announcement "Beware!
October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market." And you
shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John
Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned,
"This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they
couldn't get any worse." Detroit Free Press columnist Susan
Tompor agreed that "the next round of statements could indeed
look pretty nasty." 

We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad.
It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take 
a while. The "bottom" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes,
but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just
like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't
the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer

WINNICK: HANDS-OFF OR RED-HANDED?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before
a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN
predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected
Winnick to testify.

Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the
House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that
Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A
committee spokesman said, "If he tries to portray himself as an
out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him
that he is under oath."

The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO
Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful
language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial
Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from
the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to
unload the company -- "without looking like we are shaking our
bootie all over the world," quoted the two Timeses -- and
resigned shortly thereafter.

One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's 
time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among
the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals,
was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York
Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never
completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.

The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing 
details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence,
the gun might not be smoking yet. "Prosecutors would still need
to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used
them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the
company's stock price artificially," the Journal reporters
wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after
Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in
May 2001.

Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not
among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney
general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is
Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away
clean? - Keith Dawson

					<P>Remember when Nasdaq 2500 seemed impossibly low? Welcome back to cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the self-pity can't get much worse.</P><P>
The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. "3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87," read the Denver Post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937. Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
"self-fulfilling prophecy" does spring to mind. </P><P>
So does the phrase "gloom and doom." "Every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the United States," said the San Jose Mercury News. "Countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again," wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement, TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines "demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"
and "disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond." </P><P>
OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better? Good, because there's more.</P><P>
The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement "Beware! October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market." And you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, "This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse." Detroit Free Press columnist Susan Tompor agreed that "the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty." 
</P><P>
We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad. It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. The "bottom" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer</P><P>

					<P>Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected Winnick to testify.</P><P>
Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A committee spokesman said, "If he tries to portray himself as an out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."</P><P>
The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to unload the company -- "without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world," quoted the two Timeses -- and resigned shortly thereafter.</P><P>
One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.</P><P>
The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. "Prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially," the Journal reporters wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in May
2001.</P><P>
Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away clean? - Keith Dawson</P><P>
